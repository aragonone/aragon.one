        Aragon One is a company that encompasses the foundational team working
        on the Aragon project. The company is currently established in
        Switzerland, although we want it to function as a DAO as much as
        possible.

      <p>
        Funding for the company will come in a form of a grant given by the
        project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the
        entity.
