            Great design breaks down barriers between people and products. Tesla
            and Apple introduced millions of people to revolutionary technology
            and established new industries by building better products and user
            experiences. Reaching people is the blockchain ecosystem's biggest
            challenge. The barrier to entry is big, but design can bridge the
            gap. We're looking for a Product Designer to help us reach millions
            of people and shape the future of organizations.
